## About

The MERN Chat App is a real-time messaging platform where users can sign up, log in, and communicate in private chats. The app uses **MongoDB** as the database to store user data and messages, **Express.js** and **Node.js** to handle the backend server, and **React** to create a responsive frontend interface. **Socket.IO** is used for real-time communication between users.

### Key Features:
- Real-time messaging between users
- User authentication (sign up, login)
- Dockerized for containerized deployment
- MongoDB as the NoSQL database
- Profile picture/avatar support
- Online status tracking
- Typing indicator in chats

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in with secure JWT-based authentication.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat with other users in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Seamless two-way communication between the client and server for instant message delivery.
- **Avatar Setup**: Users can set up a profile picture after signing up.
- **Docker Support**: Both backend and frontend are Dockerized for simple and scalable deployment.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-chat-app.git
cd mern-chat-app
```

### Install Dependencies

For backend (Node.js/Express):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

For frontend (React):

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### MongoDB Setup

Make sure you have MongoDB installed locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to set up a cloud database.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directories of both backend and frontend to store environment variables.

### Backend `.env`:

```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
SOCKET_PORT=5001
```

### Frontend `.env`:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

---

## Docker Setup

### Build and Run the Application with Docker:

The application is Dockerized for easy deployment. To run the backend, frontend, and MongoDB in containers:

1. **Build and start the containers**:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

- Backend on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- MongoDB instance

2. **Stop the containers**:

To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` or run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Usage

After setting up the environment and starting the app:

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the frontend.
- Sign up with a new account or log in to chat with other users in real-time.
- Open multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate conversations between users.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js, Styled-components, Socket.IO-client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Docker**: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized services
